## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
  - Monaco Editor for code editing
  - Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
  
- **Backend:**
  - FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
  - RestrictedPython for secure code execution

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ for the backend
- Node.js 14+ for the frontend server

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GetGit789/python-interpreter-online.git
cd python-interpreter-online
```

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8002
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/
   ```

## üîí Security

The Python Interpreter Online takes security seriously:

- **Code Sandboxing**: Uses RestrictedPython to prevent malicious code execution
- **Resource Limits**: Restricts CPU time, memory usage, and process creation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting requests per user
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Module Whitelisting**: Only allows safe Python modules to be imported

## üß© Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)

The backend is built with FastAPI and provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /execute`: Executes Python code and returns the output
- `POST /token`: Authenticates users and provides access tokens
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple, responsive web application that communicates with the backend API:

- **Monaco Editor**: Provides a rich code editing experience
- **API Client**: Uses Axios to communicate with the backend
- **UI Components**: Custom-built components for a cohesive user experience

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Write Code**: Type your Python code in the editor
2. **Run Code**: Click the "Run Code" button to execute your code
3. **View Output**: See the results in the output panel below the editor
4. **Share Code**: Click "Share Code" to generate a shareable URL
5. **Copy Code**: Click "Copy Code" to copy your code to the clipboard
6. **Clear Output**: Click "Clear Output" to clear the output panel
7. **Load Examples**: Select an example from the dropdown to load pre-written code

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for multiple files and projects
- [ ] Implement user accounts for saving code snippets
- [ ] Add code formatting options
- [ ] Support for additional programming languages
- [ ] Collaborative editing features
