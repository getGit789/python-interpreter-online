# Building a Free Online Python Interpreter with FastAPI and Monaco Editor

Have you ever needed to quickly test a Python snippet without setting up a local environment? Or wanted to share executable code examples with others? That's why I built [Python Interpreter Online](https://getgit789.github.io/python-interpreter-online/) - a free, browser-based Python interpreter that makes coding and sharing Python snippets easy.

## The Problem

When teaching Python or collaborating with others, I often encountered these challenges:

1. **Setup friction**: Getting newcomers to install Python locally can be a barrier
2. **Sharing executable code**: Sending code snippets that others can run and modify
3. **Simplicity**: Existing solutions are often bloated with features or require sign-ups

## The Solution: Python Interpreter Online

I created a clean, simple solution focused on the core experience of writing, running, and sharing Python code:

- **Write code** in a beautiful Monaco Editor (the same engine that powers VS Code)
- **Run code** with a single click and see results instantly
- **Share code** via URL - perfect for teaching or getting help on forums

Try it here: [Python Interpreter Online](https://getgit789.github.io/python-interpreter-online/)

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend

The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:

```javascript
// API endpoint configuration
const isProduction = window.location.hostname === 'getgit789.github.io';
const API_URL = isProduction 
    ? 'https://python-interpreter-online.onrender.com' 
    : 'http://localhost:8002';

// Run code function
async function runCode() {
    const code = editor.getValue();
    try {
        const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/execute`, { code });
        output.textContent = response.data.output || 'No output';
        // Update status
    } catch (error) {
        handleError(error);
    }
}
```

### Backend

The backend uses FastAPI to create a secure Python execution environment:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import os

app = FastAPI()

# Configure CORS
allowed_origins = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "").split(",")
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=allowed_origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.post("/execute")
async def execute_code(request: CodeRequest):
    # Secure code execution logic
    result = execute_python_safely(request.code)
    return {"output": result}
```

### Deployment

- **Frontend**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Backend**: Render for serverless deployment

## Key Features

1. **Modern Code Editor**: Syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection
2. **Secure Execution**: Sandboxed environment with resource limits
3. **User-friendly Error Messages**: Clear explanations for common Python errors
4. **Code Sharing**: Generate shareable URLs with your code embedded
5. **Example Code**: Pre-loaded examples to help users get started

## Lessons Learned

Building this project taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Security is critical**: Executing user code requires careful sandboxing
2. **UX matters**: A clean, intuitive interface makes all the difference
3. **Cross-origin challenges**: CORS configuration is essential for frontend-backend communication
4. **Deployment separation**: Using different platforms for frontend and backend offers flexibility

## What's Next?

I'm planning to enhance the project with:

- Support for external libraries
- Multiple file support
- Code formatting options
- Improved mobile experience
- User accounts for saving snippets
