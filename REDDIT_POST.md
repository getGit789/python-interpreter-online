# I built a free, online Python interpreter with code sharing - perfect for learning and quick testing

Hi r/Python!

I wanted to share a project I've been working on: [Python Interpreter Online](https://getgit789.github.io/python-interpreter-online/), a free, browser-based Python interpreter that lets you write, run, and share Python code without installing anything.

## Why I built it

As someone who teaches Python to beginners, I noticed a few common problems:
- Setting up Python locally can be intimidating for newcomers
- Online alternatives are often bloated with features or require sign-ups
- Sharing code examples with students was cumbersome

So I built a simple, clean solution that focuses on the essentials.

## Features

- **Clean, distraction-free interface** with Monaco Editor (same as VS Code)
- **Run Python code instantly** in your browser
- **Share code via URL** - perfect for teaching or getting help
- **User-friendly error messages** that explain common mistakes
- **Dark theme** by default for reduced eye strain
- **Completely free and open source** - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/getGit789/python-interpreter-online)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: FastAPI with sandboxed Python execution
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (frontend) and Render (backend)

I'd love to hear your feedback, feature suggestions, or contributions to make it even better!

## What's next?

I'm planning to add:
- More code examples
- Support for external libraries
- Improved mobile experience
- Code formatting options

Thanks for checking it out!
